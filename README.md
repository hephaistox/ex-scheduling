# ex-scheduling

These toys code are simple implementations of the exercices of the Hephaistox scheduling courses.

The structure is the following:
* one directory by exercice, e.g. `exercice_1`
* one subdirectory by technology, e.g. `clj`
* a `data` directory with the required input if the exercice needed it

See the course for more explanation (web link is coming).
